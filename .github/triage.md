# Issues Triage Process

The triage process is designed to swiftly categorize new issues and pull requests (PRs) and take appropriate actions whenever possible.

As a new issue/PR is created, the community initiates conversations, applies suitable labels, and seeks additional information.

At Instill AI, we conduct regular triage meetings. These meetings focus on unresolved issues/PRs where consensus has not been reached, and aim to determine whether and when they should be incorporated into our roadmap.

## Triage Stages

| Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Triage | When a new issue/PR is opened, it is automatically labeled as `need triage``. Maintainers assign core members as reviewers to assess the issue/PR's characteristics. Reviewers initiate conversations with the creator of the issue/PR and apply relevant labels. If there's consensus and the issue/PR requires detailed planning, reviewers remove the `need triage`` label and add the `linear` label. |
| Plan   | Issues/PRs with the `linear` label are thoroughly reviewed and need to be planned. Reviewers determine if the issue/PR is suitable for community contribution, whether it can be added to the backlog, and discuss its potential inclusion in the roadmap and the timing thereof.                                                                                                                         |

We anticipate that most issues/PRs can follow this path, leading to efficient asynchronous resolution without waiting for triage meetings. Issues/PRs labeled as `need discussion` will be addressed during these triage meetings.

## Labels

GitHub labels assist in annotating issues/PRs with additional information. Our community uses labels, as outlined below, to convey information and facilitate decision-making regarding issues/PRs.

### Communication Labels

These labels convey the status of the triage process for an issue/PR and indicate areas where community contribution is needed. Many communication labels are replaced by other labels as the triage process progresses and the issue enters active development. For instance, the `help wanted` label is removed once an issue moves into active development and a community member takes ownership. Below are the labels in this category:

| <div style="width:150px">Label</div> | Indicates that                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `need triage`                        | Issue/PR needs triaging                                                                                                                         |
| `question`                           | The issue/PR creator needs to provide more information for meaningful triaging. When adding this label, comment about the required information. |
| `need discussion`                    | This issue/PR necessitates discussion during triage meetings. When adding this label, comment about what aspects require discussion.            |
| `good first issue`                   | Issue suitable for first-time contributors                                                                                                      |
| `help wanted`                        | Issue complexity suitable for external contributors                                                                                             |

### Metadata Labels

These labels enrich issues/PRs with metadata to aid the triage process and active development. These labels may not be removed from issues/PRs, although their values may change as development progresses. For example, the priority label may change from `priority: low` to `priority: high` as the roadmap is updated. Here is the list of labels in this category:

| <div style="width:150px">Label</div> | Indicates that                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
