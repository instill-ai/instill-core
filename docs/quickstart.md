## Onboarding
You should see the onboarding page for the first time using the console. Please enter your email to proceed.

## Add a HTTP source

After onboarding, you will be redirected to the `Pipeline` tab on the left sidebar, where you can build your first VDP pipeline by clicking `Create your first pipeline` and forever change the way you approach visual data processing workflow development.

In this tutorial you'll build your first **Sync** pipeline and trigger the pipeline to process some images. You can follow the tutorial via the `Pipeline` tab or navigate to the `Data source` tab.

A HTTP source accepts HTTP requests with image payloads to be processed by a pipeline. To set it up, just choose `HTTP` from the drop-down list below.

## Import a model from GitHub repo

To process images, here we import a model from our public GitHub repo [instill-ai/model-mobilenetv2](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-mobilenetv2). To set it up, just follow the instructions on the UI and click `Setup new model`:
1. Pick a name for your model, this will be the unique identifier of this model; 
2. Select `GitHub` from the drop-down list;
3. Fill the GitHub repository `instill-ai/model-mobilenetv2`.

VDP will fetch all the releases of the GitHub repository. Each release is converted into one model instance. You can think of an model instance as a snapshot of the imported model. The imported model could have multiple model instances, each of which is named using the release tag.

## Deploy a model instance

Once the model is imported, we pick one from all the model instances, and click `deploy` to deploy it online.

## Add a HTTP destination

Just click `Next`. Since we are building a `Sync` pipeline, the HTTP destination is automatically paired with the HTTP source.

## Set up your first pipeline

Almost done! Just give your pipeline a unique id and an optional description, and click `Set up pipeline`.

## Trigger your pipeline for the first time

Now that the `classification` pipeline is automatically activated, you can make a request to trigger the pipeline to process **multiple** images within a batch:

```bash
curl -X POST \
--data-raw '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/dog.jpg"
    },
    {
      "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/66898/elephant-cub-tsavo-kenya-66898.jpeg"
    }
  ]
}' \
http://localhost:8081/v1alpha/pipelines/classification:trigger
```
In which `8081` is the port of the local pipeline backend.


A HTTP response will return
```bash
{
  "output": {
    "classification_outputs": [
      {
        "category": "golden retriever",
        "score": 0.896806
      },
      {
        "category": "African elephant",
        "score": 0.861324
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Besides using remote image url `image_url` as payload, you can send Base64-encoded images with `image_base64`

```bash
curl -X POST \
--data-raw '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_base64": "/9j/4AAQSk...D/2Q=="
    },
    ...
  ]
}' \
http://localhost:8081/v1alpha/pipelines/classification:trigger
```

or send a multipart request

```
curl -X POST \
--form 'file=@"dog.jpg"' \
--form 'file=@"elephant.jpg"' \
http://localhost:8081/v1alpha/pipelines/classification:trigger-multipart
```
