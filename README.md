üíß **Instill VDP (Versatile Data¬†Pipeline)** is a source-available tool, designed to streamline your data processing pipelines from inception to completion. If your goal is to develop versatile AI features using Large Language Models (LLM), Generative AI, Vision, or Audio models, Instill VDP empowers you to:

- Effortlessly **connect** to your unstructured data
- **Build** pipelines to enable diverse AI functionalities in your applications
- Visually **test** pipelines with a single click, viewing output at each stage
- Easily **share** your pipelines to showcase your work

**‚òÅÔ∏è [Instill Cloud](https://console.instill.tech)** offers a fully managed public cloud service, providing you with access to all the fantastic features of Instill VDP without the burden of infrastructure management.

## Highlights

- üöÄ Accelerate AI applications by building end-to-end AI-powered pipelines for unstructured data up to 10 times faster
- üîå Utilize pre-built connectors to access data from various sources, powerful AI models, and third-party tools
- üåü Benefit from a no-code drag-and-drop pipeline builder, enabling quick and customizable application development
- ü™¢ Choose between real-time inference (SYNC) and on-demand workload (ASYNC) processing modes
- üßÅ Enjoy a scalable API-first microservice design, offering an excellent developer experience
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Leverage high-performing backends implemented in Go
- üìä Gain visibility into pipeline performance through a detailed dashboard
- ü§† Access no-code/low-code interfaces, making VDP suitable for every AI and data practitioner

## Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows yet.

- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose (specifically, `Compose V2` and `Compose specification`) to run all services locally. Please install the latest stable [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before using VDP.

## Quick Start

> **Note**
> Code in the main branch tracks under-development progress towards the next release and may not work as expected. If you are looking for a stable alpha version, please use [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/releases).

Execute the following commands to start pre-built images with all the dependencies:

**The stable release version**

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```bash
$ git clone -b v0.19.1-beta https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp

# Launch all services
$ make all
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

**The latest version for development**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp

# Launch all services
$ make latest PROFILE=all
```

üöÄ That's it! Once all the services are up with health status, the UI is ready to go at http://localhost:3000!

To shut down all running services:
```
$ make down
```

<details>
  <summary><b>üîÆ <a href="https://github.com/instill-ai/core" target="_blank">Instill Core</a>: The starting point for self-hosting Instill VDP and Instill Model</b></summary><br>

  **Instill Core**, or **Core**, serves as the bedrock upon which open-source unstructured data stack thrive. Essential services such as user management servers, databases, and third-party observability tools find their home here. Instill Core also provides deployment codes to facilitate the seamless launch of both Instill VDP and Instill Model.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>üíß <a href="https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp" target="_blank">Instill VDP</a>: AI pipeline builder for unstructured data</b></summary><br>

  **Instill VDP**, or **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, represents a comprehensive unstructured data infrastructure. Its purpose is to simplify the journey of processing unstructured data from start to finish:

  - **Extract:** Gather unstructured data from diverse sources, including AI applications, cloud/on-prem storage, and IoT devices.
  - **Transform:** Utilize AI models to convert raw data into meaningful insights and actionable formats.
  - **Load:** Efficiently move processed data to warehouses, applications, or other destinations.

  Embracing VDP is straightforward, whether you opt for Instill Cloud deployment or self-hosting via Instill Core. Consult our comprehensive [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core/vdp/deployment/overview) to delve into VDP deployment.
