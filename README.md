üíß **Instill VDP (Versatile Data¬†Pipeline)** is a source-available tool, designed to streamline your data processing pipelines from inception to completion. If your goal is to develop versatile AI features using Large Language Models (LLMs), Stable Diffusion, Vision, or Audio models, Instill VDP empowers you to:

- Effortlessly **connect** to your unstructured data
- **Build** pipelines to enable diverse AI functionalities in your applications
- Visually **test** pipelines with a single click, viewing output at each stage
- Easily **share** your pipelines to showcase your work

**‚òÅÔ∏è [Instill Cloud](https://console.instill.tech)** offers a fully managed public cloud service, providing you with access to all the fantastic features of unstructured data ETL without the burden of infrastructure management.

## Highlights

- üöÄ Accelerate AI applications by building end-to-end AI-powered pipelines for unstructured data up to 10 times faster
- üîå Utilize pre-built connectors to access data from various sources, powerful AI models, and third-party tools
- üåü Benefit from a no-code drag-and-drop pipeline builder, enabling quick and customizable application development
- ü™¢ Choose between real-time inference (SYNC) and on-demand workload (ASYNC) processing modes
- üßÅ Enjoy a scalable API-first microservice design, offering an excellent developer experience
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Leverage high-performing backends implemented in Go
- üìä Gain visibility into pipeline performance through a detailed dashboard
- ü§† Access no-code/low-code interfaces, making VDP suitable for every AI and data practitioner

## Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows yet.

- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose (specifically, `Compose V2` and `Compose specification`) to run all services locally. Please install the latest stable [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before using VDP.

## Quick Start

**Use stable release version**

Execute the following commands to pull pre-built images with all the dependencies to launch:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```bash
$ git clone -b v0.23.0-beta https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp

# Launch all services
$ make all
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

**Use latest version for local development**

Execute the following commands to build images with all the dependencies to launch:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp

# Launch all services
$ make latest PROFILE=all
```

> **Note**
> Code in the main branch tracks under-development progress towards the next release and may not work as expected. If you are looking for a stable alpha version, please use [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/releases).

üöÄ That's it! Once all the services are up with health status, the UI is ready to go at http://localhost:3000. Please find the default login credentials in the [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/latest/quickstart#self-hosted-instill-core).

To shut down all running services:
```
$ make down
```

Explore the [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/latest/core/deployment) to discover all available deployment options.
